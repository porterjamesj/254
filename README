This is all of the code I wrote for UChicago's CMSC25400, a class on
machine learning.

I am putting this out there manily in the interest of showing what
it's like to implement algorithms in Julia under a tight
deadline. PLEASE do not use any of this code for anything
important. It is definitely slow and probably incorrect in many
places.  If you want to do machine learning or similar in Julia, take
a look at some of the excellent packages in the JuliaStats
organization (www.github.com/JuliaStats).
